- Currently RangeCheck is only tested extensively for the Mage class, 
  I've included the data for other classes as well, but I couldn't test them.
  I'm not sure if the Melee range works correctly for druids, for example.

- Spell ranges are automatically parsed from the spell's tooltip text,
  so talent specific changes should be automatically taken care of (like
  Arctic Reach for frost mages). You should list all spells that can
  have different ranges depending on talents (that's why Scorch, Arcane
  Missiles and Frostbolt are all listed, even though they all have a 30 yd
  range initially).

- Ideally, RangeCheck should be initialized on PLAYER_ALIVE, but
  unfortunately the spell tooltips are not yet updated at that point. I am using
  MEETINGSTONE_CHANGED now, which seems to be OK for this purpose.

- The minimum range value (of hunter shots, for example) is not used presently,
  as it's just a tiny distance in between interact2 and interact3 values,
  and it would just cause too much flicker.
  (as a side note, according to my tests, the minumum range is somewhere
  between 9 and 10 yards, and not 8 yards as the tooltip says...)
