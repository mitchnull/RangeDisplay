SpellCaster has started out as a collection of utilities for the Mage class.
Unfortunately most of its functionality was broken with the 2.0 patch, so now
only the addon name remains, the functionality is completely new.

You can access the configuration options with the /spellcaster (or /spc) slash
command.

Options:
/spc AutoBar on|off
  if enabled, your default (blizzard) action bar will be switched to the first
  one whenever you enter combat.
  [I needed this 'cos all my out-of-combat stuff like conjure/portal/etc are
  placed on my second action bar page, and I tend to forget to switch back to
  the first one and then I try casting telepot to darnassus instead of CoC or 
  whatever, and it's usually bad for my health]
/spc RangeCheck on|off
  if enabled, your current estimated range to your target will be displayed
/spc RangeCheck unlock
  unlocks the RangeCheck display frame, so you can drag it to a position you
  like
/spc RangeCheck lock
  locks the RangeCheck display frame
/spc RangeCheck height NUM
  sets the font height of the RangeCheck display to NUM
/spc GuildTooltip on|off
  if enabled, the unit's guild name will be added to your default GameTooltip
  on mouseover
/spc RangeTooltip on|off
  if enabled, the unit's range will be added to your default GameTooltip
  on mouseover
/spc reset
  resets the configuration for this character to default values
