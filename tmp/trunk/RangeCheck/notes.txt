- Currently RangeCheck is only tested extensively for the Mage class, 
  I've included the data for other classes as well, but I couldn't test them.
  I'm not sure if the Melee range works correctly for druids, for example.

- Spell ranges are automatically parsed from the spell's tooltip text,
  so talent specific changes should be automatically taken care of (like
  Arctic Reach for frost mages). You should list all spells that can
  have different ranges depending on talents (that's why Scorch, Arcane
  Missiles and Frostbolt are all listed, even though they all have a 30 yd
  range initially).

- Ideally, RangeCheck should be initialized on PLAYER_ALIVE, but
  unfortunately the spell tooltips are not yet updated at that point, so
  now I delay the initialization 'till the first target change or first
  mouseover

- The minimum range value is not used presently, as it's just a tiny distance
  in between interact2 and interact3 values, and it would just cause too much flicker.
  (as a side note, according to my tests, the minumum range is somewhere between 9 and 10
  yards, and not 8 yards as the tooltip says...)
  
- I've done some testing without Babble, and it seems to work, but it will only work
  in English locales without Babble.
