- Currently RangeCheck only has spell data for the Mage class, to add
  other classes, initialize the HarmSpells["ClassName"] and
  FriendSpells["ClassName"] arrays with the spell names to check.

- Classes that don't have their spell lists set will only use the
  InteractDistance based range estimation (10, 11 and 28 yards at the
  moment)

- Spell ranges are automatically parsed from the spell's tooltip text,
  so talent specific changes should be automatically taken care of (like
  Arctic Reach for frost mages). You should list all spells that can
  have different ranges depending on talents (that's why Scorch, Arcane
  Missiles and Frostbolt are all listed, although they all have a 30 yd
  range initially).

- Ideally, RangeCheck should be initialized on PLAYER_ALIVE, but
  unfortunately the spell tooltips are not yet updated at that point, so
  now I delay the initialization 'till the first target change or first
  mouseover

- Right now the code doesn't handle spells with minimum range
  requirements properly (most hunter shots). I'll add that soon.

Future plans:

- display spell icon for the current range
- configuration dialog
